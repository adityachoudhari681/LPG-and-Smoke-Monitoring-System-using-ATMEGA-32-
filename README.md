This project is an embedded system designed to monitor Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and smoke levels in an environment. The system is built using the ATMEGA-32 microcontroller and includes sensors for detecting LPG and smoke. When hazardous levels of gas or smoke are detected, the system triggers an alert, helping to prevent potential fire hazards or gas leaks.

Features

-LPG Detection: Continuously monitors LPG levels in the environment and triggers an alarm if levels exceed the safety threshold.
-Smoke Detection: Detects smoke and issues a warning to prevent fire outbreaks.
-Real-time Monitoring: Provides real-time data on gas and smoke levels.
-User Alerts: Includes both audible and visual alarms to alert users in case of danger.
-Low Power Consumption: Optimized to consume minimal power, making it suitable for continuous operation.

Components Used

-ATMEGA-32 Microcontroller: Acts as the brain of the system, processing input from sensors and controlling the outputs.
-MQ-2 Gas Sensor: Used for detecting LPG and smoke levels.
-LCD Display: Displays real-time gas and smoke levels (optional).

Applications

-Home Safety: Can be installed in kitchens or near gas cylinders to monitor LPG leaks.
-Industrial Safety: Used in factories and warehouses where flammable gases or materials are present.
Environmental Monitoring: Suitable for monitoring air quality in various environments.

How It Works

The system continuously monitors the environment using the MQ-2 sensor, which detects the concentration of LPG and smoke. The ATMEGA-32 microcontroller processes the sensor data and displays its readings on the LCD display.
